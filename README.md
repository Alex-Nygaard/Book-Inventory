### Criteria A - Planning

#### Identify the client
The client is Christ Precieux (CP), a student attending UWC ISAK Japan. CP currently owns a collection of books, which are completely unorganised. All of his books have certain characteristics which he wants to document and categorise, such that it is easier for him to understand and be aware of his book collection at all times. At this time, there is no system in place to handle this organisation.

#### Explicit consultation with client (reference appendix)
