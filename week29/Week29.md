# Syllabus question
## You have been given 5000 USD to build your dream computer. The only condition is that you cannot buy a prebuilt computer. Describe what parts you would buy, and Explain how they work as a system to create a computer.

My part list is outlined below, with justification and explanation.

### CPU
As the brains of the computer, the CPU is critical. It is here that the computational power lies, which makes the software on run. Billions of tiny transistors (small switches) make this possible, and millions and millions of arithmetic and logical operations are done each second. **I would buy an Intel Core i9-9900K (8-cores, 16 threads, 3.6 Ghz base clock)**

### GPU
This is the graphics card, the component responsible for computing and displaying an image on a screen or monitor. This is used instead of the CPU for video output because it is especially designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer. **I would buy a Nvidia RTX 2080 ti (11 GB GDDR6 memory)**

### Memory (RAM)
The memory serves as a middle buffer between the storage and CPU. Instructions from the programs (located in the storage) are stored for later use by the CPU. **I would buy Corsair Dominator Platinum 32 GB (3200 MHz DDR4 SDRAM)**

### Storage
The storage is where the OS and all the users files are stored. Previously hard disks were widely used, however much faster solutions have been on the market for a long time. SSDs are the best alternative. **I would buy 2x Gigabyte AORUS NVMe Gen4 M.2 1TB**

### Motherboard
The motherboard is a printed cicuit board and allocates power and allows communication to and between the CPU, RAM and all the other computer components. It is here for example the RAM is installed, in addition to some high-speed SSDs. In addition, the motherboard includes all the output ports (USB, Ethernet, HDMI) **I would buy the ASUS ROG MAXIMUS XI HERO (With WiFi capabilities, bluetooth, 4x RAM slots, 2x M.2 NVMe slots etc.)**

### Power supply
Computer components require plenty of power to work, especially high powerful ones. Therefore, it is essential to have a big enough power supply such that you dont limit the capabilities of your other components. The power supply is responsible for converting electric current from a source to the correct voltage, current and frequency. I would buy a **Seasonic PRIME 1300W**

### Case
The case is there to keep it all together - to be able to mount the parts together and control the wire management. Another important part of cases to keep in mind is airflow (natural cooling capabilities). **I would buy Corsair Obsidian 1000D (Full-tower)**

### Water cooling
An essential part that is often overlooked is the cooling. I want to use water cooling because a liquid coolant is more effective to keep the components cool compared to air and airflow. **I would custom build my water cooling with Corsairs components**

### Periferals
I would also buy periferals, such as a keyboard, mouse and dual displays.
