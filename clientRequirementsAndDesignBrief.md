# My role as a CLIENT

### Communication with developer

**Dear Ms. Etherington,**

In my food storage, I have a collection of candy and sweets of which I want to categorise and systematically organise information about the various brands and foods. Currently there is no system in place or organise this information.

The characteristics I want to track and keep a record of for each candy is:

• Name of the brand
• Weight
• Expiration date
• Calories per 100g
• Taste category
• Sweet
• Sour
• Salt
• Quantity (number of packages)

I want to be able to register when I have eaten a package, such that I know how many are left. In addition, I want the system to be exclusively accessible to me.

Kind regards,
Alexander Nygaard

### Response from developer
Dear Mr. Nygaard,

Thank you for your email. I will design a system for you, with a secure login, that keeps track of the candy based on brand, weight, expiration date, calories per 100g, taste category, and quantity. This system will allow you to record when you have eaten your snacks, so that you know how many you have left.

Let me know if there is anything else you need.

Warm regards,
Lydia Etherington

### Request from client
Dear Nyggis,

I am writing you this note to let you  know my requirements for the inventory

I have got a lot of books in my room and usually it is demanding even to find the one that I want to make use of. It takes a few minutes to find what book I’m looking for, so I require an easy inventory that should work easily and allow me to choose any book that I want without looking for it in all of my room. That should include a specific order such show me what I want by different categories, such as author, editor, cover color, new or old one, by date of publication, for the best inventory i need to see the book that i have to read often. In the same perspective, i would like inner this inventory, separate authors by continent then a little bit far, separate their nation, all a place that i can identify author by their literary genre, by century; So to make everything easy, i want a quick button of seeking for any of my books, once a enter the book's name or author the list appears.

All my respect


### My reply to the client
Dear Mr. CP,

I hereby recognise your problem and dedicate myself to find a satisfactory solution to address these needs.

I am going to design a book inventory software application for my client including a secured login system. The software application will help my client reliably and securely keep track of his books’ authors, continent and nationality of author, editor, cover coloraturas, date of publication and how many times the client has read the book previously.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if there are any modifications you would like to make to this system.

I look forward to our future collaboration.

Kind regards,
Alexander Nygaard
